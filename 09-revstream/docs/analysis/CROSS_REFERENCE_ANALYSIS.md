   - Financial professional
   - Recipient of trial balance email (Aug 13, 2020)
   - Witness to Bantjies' financial system control
   - Meeting participant for financial statement finalization

## Critical Data Quality Issues Confirmed

### 1. ORG_007 Duplication (CONFIRMED CRITICAL)

- ReZonance: Victim, IT services provider since 2017, owed R1.035M
- Adderory: Accomplice, Rynette's son (Darren Dennis Farrar)'s companies, registered April 2021

**Required Fix:**
- Separate Adderory into ORG_009 and ORG_010 (two companies)

- Link to ORG_009 and ORG_010 (Adderory companies)
- Link to DOMAIN_002 (fraudulent domain registration)

### 3. Missing Historical Events (CONFIRMED)

**Ad-Res-J7 Evidence:**
- April 2021: Adderory companies registration
- 2023: Kayla Pretorius murder
- January 2025: Chantal letter about estate

## Evidence Strength Summary

| Inter-company transactions | Strong | Financial statements |
| Email forensics | Strong | System analysis |
| Kayla murder | Medium | Referenced but pending access |
| Estate exploitation | Medium | Referenced but pending access |

## Conclusion

The ad-res-j7 repository provides substantial additional evidence and context that significantly enhances the RevStream1 data models. The most critical findings are:

1. **ReZonance and Adderory are separate entities** - requires immediate fix
2. **Rynette's son (Darren Dennis Farrar) (PERSON_003) must be added** - critical for conspiracy network
3. **Pre-planning evidence (April 2021)** - demonstrates long-term conspiracy
4. **Historical events (2023-early 2025)** - provides crucial context
5. **Email forensics evidence** - strengthens control and impersonation claims

These enhancements will significantly improve the accuracy, completeness, and evidentiary strength of the data models.
