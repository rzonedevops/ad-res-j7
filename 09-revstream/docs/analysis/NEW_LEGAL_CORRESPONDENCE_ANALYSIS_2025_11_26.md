### Key Points

#### Rynette Farrar's Position
Rynette Farrar has retained Elliott Attorneys and claims she was not a party to the litigation (Case 2025-137857), therefore received no notice, no right of reply, and no procedural opportunity to defend herself against allegations made about her personally.

#### Allegations Made Against Rynette in Jacqueline's Affidavit

The letter identifies seven specific allegations from Jacqueline's answering affidavit:

1. **Payment Diversion** (para 75): Accused of instructing customers to divert payments into different accounts, depleting company funds
2. **Bank Account Control** (para 66, 146, 148): Accused of controlling bank accounts unlawfully and taking instructions only from Peter
3. **UK Business Revenue Theft** (para 94-96): Accused of starting a UK business that "takes revenue and profit" from respondent companies
4. **Domain Registration & Unlawful Competition** (para 95-97, 130-132): Accused of competing unlawfully through Addarory (Pty) Ltd and domain regimaskin.co.za while employed as bookkeeper
5. **Customer Redirection** (para 134-135): Accused of redirecting customers to a company owned by her son (Darren Dennis Farrar), acting "in consort" and pilfering business opportunities
6. **False Photos & Brand Damage** (para 119, 137): Accused of posting false, misleading photos detrimental to RegimA brand, creating unauthorized false affiliation
7. **Stock Theft Risk** (para 114-115): Accused of posing a risk of taking R5 million worth of stock or using stock/raw materials for the UK entity

#### Implied Allegations

The letter states these allegations collectively assert or imply:
1. Dishonesty
2. Fraud
3. Misappropriation
4. Breach of confidentiality
5. Violation of non-disclosure and non-compete agreements
6. Theft or pilfering of stock and raw materials
7. Financial misconduct and manipulation of corporate accounts
8. Unlawful competition

#### Demands (48-hour deadline)

1. **Written retraction and apology** to Rynette for publication of untrue and defamatory allegations (to be recorded in affidavit)
2. **Cease and desist** from making further defamatory statements in pleadings, correspondence, publications, or communications
3. **Written confirmation** that Jacqueline will not republish or repeat defamatory statements, nor permit third parties to do so (to be recorded in affidavit)

## Document 2: Letter to Opposing Attorney (KF0019)

### Basic Information
- **From:** Elliott Attorneys (representing Rynette Farrar and others)
- **To:** Pottas Attorneys (representing Peter Faucitt)
- **Date:** 26 November 2025
- **Reference:** KRE/RVR/KF0019
- **Case:** 2025-137857

### Key Points

#### Context
References the dismissal of "our client's latest urgent application" - indicating Jacqueline/Daniel's Application 3 (Contact Interdict) was dismissed.

#### Warnings to Peter Faucitt (via his attorneys)

1. **Initial Court Order Still in Force**: The initial interdict (Application 1, granted August 19, 2025) remains in force and is of full effect
2. **Contempt of Court**: Any conduct contravening the order may result in contempt of court application
3. **Settlement Agreement Application Pending**: The application for settlement agreements to be made orders of court (Application 2) is still pending

#### New Allegation

**Work Phone Removal**: Peter has "once again, removed the work phone from *inter alia* the custody and use of the staff situate at our clients' common home, which *inter alia* prevents the handling of stock."

This is described as urgent and Peter is requested to desist immediately.

#### Audit Agreement Request

References paragraph 2.2 of the agreement between parties (the "audit agreement") and requests that Peter's further communications to the entities regarding payments be directed by Pottas Attorneys to Elliott Attorneys to prevent further conduct as outlined in their client's applications.

## Legal Significance

### 1. New Entity Identified: Elliott Attorneys

- **Entity Type:** Law Firm
- **Role:** Legal representation for Rynette Farrar (and possibly others)
- **Significance:** Rynette has now formally entered the legal proceedings through representation

### 2. New Event: Application 3 Dismissal

- **Date:** Before 26 November 2025
- **Event:** Application 3 (Contact Interdict against Jacqueline) was dismissed
- **Significance:** Peter's Application 3 was unsuccessful

### 3. Defamation Claim Strategy

Rynette is pursuing a defamation strategy based on:
- Not being a party to the original litigation
- No opportunity to defend herself
- Allegations made in Jacqueline's affidavit are defamatory

**Legal Analysis:** This is a tactical move. While Rynette was not a named respondent, she was extensively referenced in the founding affidavit as a co-conspirator. The question is whether statements made in court documents enjoy qualified privilege.

### 4. Ongoing Interdict Violations

The letter KF0019 indicates Peter continues to violate the initial interdict order by:
- Removing work phone from staff at common home
- Preventing handling of stock

This suggests ongoing contempt of court issues.

### 5. Settlement Agreement Still Pending

Application 2 (to make settlement agreements orders of court) remains pending, indicating the mediation agreements from September 18, 2025 have not been formalized.

## Strategic Analysis

### Rynette's Defamation Strategy

**Strengths:**
- Not a named party to original litigation
- Allegations are serious (fraud, theft, dishonesty)
- 48-hour deadline creates pressure

**Weaknesses:**
- Statements in court documents typically enjoy qualified privilege
- Allegations are supported by evidence in the repository
- Defamation claim may be difficult to prove if statements are true or made in good faith

### Peter's Position

**Challenges:**
- Application 3 dismissed (third unsuccessful application)
- Ongoing interdict violations reported
- Settlement agreement still not formalized
- Now facing defamation counterclaim from Rynette

### Jacqueline/Daniel's Position

**Opportunities:**
- Application 3 dismissal is a victory
- Rynette's defamation claim can be defended with evidence
- Ongoing interdict violations strengthen contempt of court case

**Risks:**
- Must respond to Letter of Demand within 48 hours
- Defamation litigation could be costly and distracting
- Need to ensure all statements in affidavits are supported by evidence

---

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (within 48 hours)

1. **Respond to Letter of Demand** with evidence-supported refutation
2. **Document all evidence** supporting allegations against Rynette
3. **Prepare defamation defense** based on truth and qualified privilege

### Short-term

1. **Update data models** with new entities, events, and evidence
2. **Create dedicated page** for defamation claim analysis
3. **Compile evidence dossier** specifically addressing each of the 7 allegations

### Medium-term

1. **Pursue contempt of court** application for ongoing interdict violations
2. **Formalize settlement agreement** (Application 2)
3. **Prepare counter-defamation claim** if Rynette's allegations are false

## Evidence Quality Assessment

### Allegations Against Rynette - Evidence Strength

| Allegation | Evidence Strength | Key Evidence |
|------------|------------------|--------------|
| 1. Payment Diversion | **STRONG** | Bank records, email instructions, Shopify configuration |
| 2. Bank Account Control | **STRONG** | Banking records, email correspondence, system access logs |
| 3. UK Business Revenue Theft | **STRONG** | Shopify ownership records, payment routing, 28 months of invoices |
| 4. Domain & Unlawful Competition | **STRONG** | Domain registration (Addarory), regimaskin.co.za, employment records |
| 5. Customer Redirection | **MEDIUM** | Circumstantial evidence, customer communications |
| 6. False Photos & Brand Damage | **MEDIUM** | Social media posts, brand analysis |
| 7. Stock Theft Risk | **WEAK** | Speculative, no direct evidence of actual theft |

**Overall Assessment:** Most allegations (5 of 7) are supported by **strong to medium** evidence. The defamation claim is defensible.
