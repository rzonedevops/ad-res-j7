## 6. Recommendations

The data models are in excellent condition. The following minor refinements are recommended:

1.  **Review Unassigned Events:** Assign the 11 events currently marked as `unknown` to their correct timeline phase to complete the narrative sequence.
2.  **Review Person Entity:** Review the 1 person entity flagged for having no direct event involvement to confirm their role is accurate or if links are missing.
