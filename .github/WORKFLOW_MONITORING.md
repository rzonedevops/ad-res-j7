# Workflow Monitoring Dashboard

## Overview

This repository includes comprehensive monitoring and alerting for all GitHub Actions workflows. The monitoring system automatically detects failures, analyzes patterns, and creates alerts when issues require attention.

## Health Status Files

The monitoring system maintains health status files in `.github/workflow-health/`:

### Current Status Files
- `overall-status.txt` - Overall system health (healthy/warning/critical)
- `last-check.txt` - Timestamp of last monitoring check  
- `current-health.json` - Detailed health metrics per workflow
- `latest-analysis.json` - Most recent comprehensive analysis

### Historical Tracking
- Individual workflow success rates
- Failure pattern trends over time
- Alert history and resolution tracking

## Monitoring Schedule

### Continuous Monitoring
- **Workflow Run Triggers**: After every workflow completion
- **Real-time Alerts**: Immediate failure detection
- **Pattern Analysis**: After each run completion

### Periodic Health Checks  
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Every 6 hours
- **Pattern Detection**: 24-hour rolling analysis
- **Reliability Assessment**: Daily scheduled validation

### On-Demand Monitoring
- Manual trigger support for immediate analysis
- Configurable analysis periods (default: 24 hours)
- Custom threshold testing

## Response Procedures

### For Critical Alerts (🚨)
1. **Immediate Response** (< 2 hours)
   - Check workflow run logs for immediate causes
   - Verify repository permissions and access
   - Check for infrastructure-level issues
   
2. **Emergency Mitigation**
   - Disable failing workflows if necessary
   - Implement manual processes for critical functions
   - Notify repository maintainers

3. **Resolution Tracking**
   - Document root cause analysis
   - Test fixes thoroughly
   - Monitor recovery metrics

### For High Priority Alerts (⚠️)
1. **Investigation** (< 24 hours)
   - Review workflow logs and error messages
   - Check for recent changes that may have caused failures
   - Verify dependencies and external services

2. **Fix Implementation**
   - Address identified issues
   - Test fixes in development environment
   - Deploy fixes with monitoring

### for Reliability Alerts (📊)  
1. **Pattern Analysis** (< 48 hours)
   - Review historical trends and patterns
   - Identify correlations with code changes or external factors
   - Assess infrastructure capacity and performance

2. **Preventive Actions**
   - Optimize workflow performance
   - Improve error handling and retry logic
   - Update monitoring thresholds if needed

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Failure Scenarios

#### Permission Issues
- **Symptoms**: Git push failures, issue creation failures
- **Solutions**: Check GITHUB_TOKEN permissions, verify repository settings

#### Script Errors  
- **Symptoms**: JavaScript runtime errors, syntax errors
- **Solutions**: Review embedded scripts, validate JSON parsing, check Node.js compatibility

#### Resource Limitations
- **Symptoms**: Timeouts, memory errors, rate limiting
- **Solutions**: Optimize scripts, add delays, check GitHub API limits

#### External Dependencies
- **Symptoms**: Network failures, service unavailability  
- **Solutions**: Add retry logic, implement fallback mechanisms, verify service status
