# Todo Folder

This folder includes changes and/or updates that need to be implemented in the ad-res-j7 repository.

## Purpose

The todo folder serves as a central location for tracking improvements, recommendations, and action items for Case 2025-137857. Files in this folder are automatically processed by the GitHub Actions workflow to generate tracked issues.

## Current Todo Documents

### Active Todo Files

1. **Repository_Status_and_Critical_Evidence_Collection.md** (NEW - October 13, 2025)
   - Comprehensive action plan based on repository status assessment
   - 77 total tasks across 15 priority sections
   - Critical evidence collection requirements (32 critical tasks)
   - Repository maintenance and optimization (26 high-priority tasks)
   - Affidavit preparation and quality assurance (19 medium-priority tasks)
   - 4-week timeline with clear milestones

2. **Improvements for Jax-Dan Response Based on AD Elements.md**
   - Detailed analysis of jax-dan-response against AD framework
   - Paragraph-by-paragraph improvement recommendations
   - Evidence architecture enhancements
   - Strategic narrative development

3. **Executive Summary_ Jax-Dan Response Improvements.md**
   - High-level overview of critical gaps
   - Top 5 priority recommendations
   - Current strengths and weaknesses analysis
   - Implementation roadmap

### Workflow Test Files

4. **workflow-validation-tests.md**
   - Tests for GitHub Actions workflow functionality
   - Issue generation validation
   - Label assignment verification

5. **workflow-test.md**
   - Basic workflow testing scenarios
   - Issue creation validation

6. **simple-workflow-test.md**
   - Simplified workflow test cases
   - Quick validation checks

## How It Works

### Automatic Issue Generation

When todo files are committed to the repository:

1. **GitHub Actions Trigger**: The todo-to-issues workflow automatically runs
2. **Task Detection**: Workflow parses markdown files for actionable tasks
3. **Issue Creation**: Creates GitHub issues with appropriate labels and priorities
4. **Tracking**: Each issue links back to source file and line number

### Task Format

Tasks are detected using multiple methods:

#### Priority Sections
```markdown
### Must-Do (Phase 1)
1. First critical task
2. Second critical task

### Should-Do (Phase 2)
1. First high-priority task
2. Second high-priority task

### Nice-to-Have (Phase 3)
1. First medium-priority task
2. Second medium-priority task
```

#### Actionable Items
```markdown
**Improvements Needed**:
- Implement priority-based response architecture
- Create comprehensive timeline analysis
- Enhance evidence architecture
```

### Priority Mapping

- **Must-Do (Phase 1)** → `priority: critical` + `bug` labels
- **Should-Do (Phase 2)** → `priority: high` label
- **Nice-to-Have (Phase 3)** → `priority: medium` label

All tasks automatically receive `todo` and `enhancement` labels.

## Usage Guidelines

### For Contributors

1. **Create New Todo Files**: Follow the priority section format shown above
2. **Use Action Words**: Include clear action verbs (implement, create, add, fix, etc.)
3. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, actionable task descriptions
4. **Include Context**: Reference relevant files, sections, or evidence codes
5. **Add JSON Companion**: Create matching .json file for structured data

### For Reviewers

1. **Check Priority Alignment**: Ensure tasks are in appropriate priority sections
2. **Verify Actionability**: Confirm tasks are specific and achievable
3. **Review Dependencies**: Identify task dependencies and sequencing
4. **Validate References**: Ensure all file references and evidence codes are correct

### For Project Managers

1. **Monitor Issue Generation**: Review created issues after todo file commits
2. **Track Progress**: Use GitHub issue labels to filter and track progress
3. **Update Priorities**: Adjust priority sections as case develops
4. **Archive Completed**: Move completed todo files to archive when done
